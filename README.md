# primerDSA

Julia implementation of “The Last Algorithms Course You’ll Need” by ThePrimeagen

that is to say: DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) primer in Julia

course materials: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/

unit testing: https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine/tree/master/src/%5F%5Ftests%5F%5F
<!-- to properly escape double underscore --><br />
be careful with array index as JavaScript is 0-based while Julia is 1-based

why Julia ? it’s high-level enough to write easily like Python but much faster, without resorting to low-level C++ or worse Java headache

require Julia version ≥ 1.9
